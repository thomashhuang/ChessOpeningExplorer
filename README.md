This is an OpenFrameworks application to analyze, review, and study chess openings and player repertoire.  

Written for my final project for CS 126 at UIUC.


## Libraries
[pgnlib] is used to import PGN files into memory, and the internal game tree data structure will organize the games in a way that can easily be traversed.
To install pgnlib, you will need to run the following in the pgnlib directory:
> ./configure  
> make  
> make install  

[ofxDatGui] is used for several UI elements.
To install ofxDatGui, clone the repo into your openFrameworks/addons directory, then copy the ofxbraitsch directory into bin/data. Run the project generator with ofxDatGui selected as an addon, then simply add:  
> #include "ofxDatGui.h"  

to ofApp.h.

## Classes
#### GameTree:  
This holds the internal structure that keeps track of all the positions, games, and results. It uses TreeNodes which represent a certain position and hold a Ply and a map of continuations from that particular position.  
  
#### GameTraversal:  
Used to traverse through the GameTree. It is constructed with a GameTree object and uses the method push_back(Ply) to traverse through the "database" represented by the GameTree. It also supports going back up the tree using pop_back().  

##### Communication:
UI and Model communicate through the GameTraversal, which will get continuations using GetContinuations, and will send the position to the UI using a pgn::Position object. The UI converts the Position object to FEN notation and draws the board from that.

## Usage
To run the app (in XCode), simply open the .xcodeproj file and hit the play button.
You will need to uplaod a PGN file (or multiple) using the GUI in the bottom right of the app.
The app searches in bin/data/games for the file that you name in the text input box.
Two Grandmaster sample databases have been provided as Carlsen.pgn and Caruana.pgn. These samples contain around 2400 and 1900 games respectively.  
When writing notes, the notes will be saved in bin/data/notes. The notes will automatically append to the file, so you can easily write several notes in similar positions to the same file.
