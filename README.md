[pgnlib]: http://pgnlib.sourceforge.net/ "pgnlib"

## Libraries
[pgnlib] is used to import PGN files into memory, and the internal game tree data structure will organize the games in a way that can easily be traversed.
To install pgnlib, you will need to run the following in the pgnlib directory:
> ./configure
> make
> make install

## Classes
GameTree:
This holds the internal structure that keeps track of all the positions, games, and results. It uses TreeNodes which represent a certain position and hold a Ply and a map of continuations from that particular position.
GameTraversal:
Used to traverse through the GameTree. It is constructed with a GameTree object and uses the method push_back(Ply) to traverse through the "database" represented by the GameTree. It also supports going back up the tree using pop_back().
